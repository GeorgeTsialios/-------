# Sports-scheduling-for-amateur-leagues

The well-known "Sports Scheduling Problem" is being studied in this project. The problem aims to find the optimal match schedule aka when teams will play against each other. We focus on the example of an amateur football tournament. Our goal is to satisfy the needs of both parties involved: <ul> <li> The tournament organizers </li> <li> The tournamnent players </li>  </ul> in the best way possible.

First of all, we define what an amateur league is and compare them to professional leagues. Then we outline the problem at hand. After a brief literature review, we model the problem using Linear Programming techniques and solve it using Python's PuLP library. In the end, we analyze some test runs of the program and test its performance and scalability.
